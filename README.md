# Fake News Classification

This project focuses on classifying and analyzing fake news using machine learning techniques such as confusion matrix, TfidVectorizer, and PassiveAgressiveClassifier. It utilizes Python along with popular data science libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The analysis is based on a labeled dataset, and the accuracy score of the classification is predicted.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda Navigator

## Libraries Utilized

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as fake or genuine based on their content. The process involves preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features using TfidfVectorizer, training the model using PassiveAgressiveClassifier, and evaluating its performance using a confusion matrix.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
